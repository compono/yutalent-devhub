# Plugin Template

So developers know how we like to work, we have created a plugin template for you. 

Use this as a start point before you begin to develop your plugin.

Remember you have to <a href="http://www.clahub.com/agreements/oneworldmarket/yutalent-devhub"> agree and sign the Contributor License Agreement</a> before we can accept any code work from you.

### Our plugin template logic and rules

- All plugin options are kept centrally in the config.inc.php but you will NEVER INCLUDE SENSITIVE DATA such as passwords, API keys, or any other data that could compromise the security of yutalent ltd, its partners or other developers in any way within this file.

- All external libraries and any other code reference material is filed away in the libraries folder

- All visual templates and html is stored in the views folder

- All images added into the images folder

- All JS files added into the js folder

- Wherever possible use our existing style sheets, however if you do need to add your own styles then store them in the pluginName.css style sheet

- Every folder will contain an EMPTY index.php file for security
