===============

We try to keep our developer community as open source as possible for the benefit of all our developers and partners - and to make the yu:talent developer framework as useful and flexible as we can.

As we build plugins and extensions to our product we keep the code open and re-usable - for use in your own plugins or to improve the ones we already have. Don't forget to <a href="http://www.clahub.com/agreements/oneworldmarket/yutalent-devhub">sign the Contributor License Agreement</a> before getting started.
